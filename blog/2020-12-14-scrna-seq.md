Over the past year we've done a bunch of outreach to labs within the genomics community here at the UW. Given my research background it's where I feel most comfortable and this type of research is underrepresented on the cluster. Given where the field is going it's inconceivable they aren't using Hyak or HPC in general! Those lab closet clusters and under bench servers gotta go, there is a better way and we'll show you how to do some scRNA-seq today ðŸ™‚
