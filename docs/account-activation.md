UW policy is that all services (of which HYAK is one) require 2 factor authentication (2FA) by default as a security posture.

:::important
You need 2FA to log onto any HYAK cluster.
:::

You can use a personal device (e.g., phone, tablet) or a land line as your two-factor token, please go to [this 2FA page](https://identity.uw.edu/2fa/) and ensure you have it enabled and configured. If you wish to use an older style single purpose token, visit [this page](http://www.washington.edu/itconnect/service/authentication/) and ask for a security token.

:::tip
Sign up for the HYAK mailing list [here](https://mailman1.u.washington.edu/mailman/listinfo/hyak-users) and stay up to date on system news!
:::

The HYAK mailing list is low volume (average < 1 email per month) and provides critical announcements in the event of a service issue, maintenance, or other updates.
